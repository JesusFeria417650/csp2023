  <p>My name is Jesus Feria and I am a freshman at Santa Ana HighSchool.</p>
  <p>I don't recall having taken any other CSE classes in the past I believe this is my first time taking one.</p>
  <p>The main reason for taking the course was because it looked pretty fun when I was looking over all the options.</p>
  <p>Some of my personal intrests are just playing video games or playing soccer.</p>
